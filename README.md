## Bio

I am a computational biologist at [GSK](https://www.gsk.com).
I was previously a PhD fellow at the [European Bioinformatics Institute EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) and the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), supervised by [Dr. Alex Bateman](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/bateman).
I also completed a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology at the [Autonomous University of Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/en/), followed by a Master's in Computational Biology at the [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch), where I joined the research group of [Dr. Guido Capitani](https://www.psi.ch/en/lbr/guido-capitani-1970-2017) at the [Paul Scherrer Institute](https://www.psi.ch).

## Research

I develop computational methods and algorithms, applying machine learning and other statistical methods, to model the sequence and structure of proteins with the aim to understand their function, evolution and role in disease.
As part of my PhD, I have worked on a project to computationally classify and model tandem domain repeats in multidomain proteins, integrating various genomics and protein structure datasets. 
I have worked on several research projects and methods, including the [EPPIC tool](http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/) for the classification of protein-protein interfaces, the analysis of symmetry in protein structures with [CE-Symm](https://github.com/rcsb/symmetry), and the [BioJava](https://biojava.org/) open-source bioinformatics library. 
I have also been an assessor of protein assembly models in two editions (2016 and 2018) of [CASP](https://predictioncenter.org/index.cgi?page=assessors_list), an international challenge for protein structure prediction methods, contributing new evaluation scores and analyses.
